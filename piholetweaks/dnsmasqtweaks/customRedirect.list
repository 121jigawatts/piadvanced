## This config will theoretically let you redirect a page to something other than 127.0.0.1 or localhost
#
## Example:
# If you want to redirect bing to google,,,
# google.com bing.com
#
#Or if you want requests for a website to be redirected to a internal site.
# IPADDRESSOFINTERNAL bing.com
#
## This may not always work
